# Terraform Workspaces – Managing Multiple Environments easly  

In this sample use case, I demonstrate how to manage infrastructure for multiple environments using Terraform Workspaces, along with .tfvars files and variable management techniques.  

I have created three Terraform workspaces — dev, staging, and prod — each maintaining an isolated state. All environments use the same configuration structure, with environment-specific values defined in their respective .tfvars files. This ensures consistency across deployments.
